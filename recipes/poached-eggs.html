    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These sous vide eggs have a perfectly set white with a runny yolk. 
        Poached eggs are normally cooked directly in simmering water, 
        but that can be tricky and lead to rubbery, messy eggs. 
        I have tried different variations of times and temps, and this is the best method I have found. 
        Fresh eggs have tighter whites and produce the best results.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sous vide "poached" eggs can be made up to 5 days ahead of time for busy weekday mornings. 
        When done poaching, immediately plunge into an ice bath, cool, 
        then refrigerate in a sealed container. 
        To reheat, fill a coffee mug 3/4 full with water and microwave for 1 minute. 
        Place egg inside and let sit for 12 to 15 minutes before serving.

            Gently lower eggs into the water using a slotted spoon. 
            Immediately set a kitchen timer for 13 minutes.

            Remove eggs from water once timer is up and let cool for 3 minutes.
