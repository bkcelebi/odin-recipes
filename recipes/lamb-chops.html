    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Give your lamb chops a quick soak in a flavorful marinade. 
        What ingredients are best for marinating lamb chops? 
        Try balsamic vinegar, garlic, a little olive oil, and seasonings. 
        (We have many more marinade options below.) 
        How long should you marinate your lamb chops? 
        Give them anywhere from 2 hours to overnight, marinated in the fridge.
    </p>
    <p>As it gets close to grilling time, preheat the grill to medium-high heat.</p>
    <p>
        Next, it's chops to the grill! 
        Lay them out on the hot grill and sear for about 4 to 7 minutes; 
        turn, and sear for another 4 to 7 minutes -- for medium rare, 
        an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 to 130 degrees 
        F (54 degrees C). TIP: To keep the exposed bones of your chops from blackening, 
        wrap them up with a little aluminum foil before putting the lamb chops on the grates.
